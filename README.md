# Waitlist-Watcher
A basic GUI to aid UVIC students in finding a seat in a course.

# Usage
This project uses python3, and will assume that the `python` commmand is a python3 command.

After cloning the repo, navigate to /.../Waitlist-Watcher/ and run the command
``` commandline
python .
```
This will launch a GUI that will allow you to choose which course, and optionally
to have the program watch for an opening, and send you an email should one appear.

# Development

In order to begin developing, you first need to install the requirements. This can 
be done with:
``` commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
from the directory with requirements.txt in it.
